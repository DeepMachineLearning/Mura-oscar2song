# MURA Team 2 Repo

This repo will be mainly designated for collaboratively learning about CV and showcasing our work on the MURA competition.

### Planned folder structure:
```
├── data
│   ├── MNIST_data
│   └── MURA-v1.1
│       ├── train
│       └── valid
├── models
├── setup
└── utils
```

- data: contains the MURA dataset and MNIST dataset. Note that this folder is not uploaded to github
- models: to contain all the model scripts and stored models
- setup: contains the instructions to setup environment and datasets
- utils: stores useful scripts so that we can import to our notebooks.

Note that this structure is preliminary. If it's deemed not flexible enough as we progress we'll update it
